TODO:
    [X] add interval to streak
    [X] accumulator_increment should be accumulator_increment
        * accumulator_increment is now derived: (sum increment * ((end - start) * interval))
    [ ] interval should be on goal
    [ ] accumulator info should be on goal, not streak
    [ ] more rest-y put endpoints?
